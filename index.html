               Projects
            </h2>
            <p>
              Over the years, I have had the privilege of working on a variety of projects that have significantly contributed to my growth as a software developer and engineer. My journey in game development began with the Godot engine, where I immersed myself in the world of 2D and 3D game creation. Utilizing GDScript, I developed several games that explore both simple and complex game mechanics. These projects not only honed my programming skills but also deepened my understanding of the intricacies involved in game design, physics, and user experience.
              In parallel, I ventured into web development, building dynamic and responsive websites. My work in this area involved using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create visually appealing front-end designs, while also integrating Python with frameworks such as Django and Flask to handle backend functionalities. This combination allowed me to create robust and scalable web applications that cater to various user needs.
              My interest in computer graphics led me to explore OpenGL, where I worked on projects that delve into rendering techniques and real-time 3D graphics. Through this, I gained a solid foundation in shaders, textures, and the overall graphics pipeline, which significantly enhanced my capability to create visually rich and performance-optimized applications.
              Furthermore, I have extensive experience working with databases, particularly MySQL and SQLite. I have integrated these databases into Python applications, ensuring efficient data storage, retrieval, and management. These projects have allowed me to understand the importance of data integrity and the role of databases in maintaining seamless application functionality.
              Each of these projects has played a crucial role in shaping my skills and knowledge. I am continuously looking for opportunities to expand my expertise and take on new challenges.
